# xState Devtools

**Explore, navigate, and visualize your [XState](https://stately.ai/docs) machines without leaving VS Code.** xState Devtools turns your state machines into an interactive **outline** and a live **statechart diagram**, analyzing your source statically — no need to run your app. Works with XState **v4 and v5**, in JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Quick start

1. Install the extension and open a JavaScript/TypeScript project that uses XState.
2. Click the **xState Devtools** icon in the activity bar to open the **Search** and **Outline** views.
3. Click any node to jump to its source, or use **View State Diagram** to open a machine as a statechart.

> No configuration required — machines are discovered automatically as you edit.

## Features

### 🌲 Interactive outline
- **Workspace scanning** — finds every XState machine in your project and updates live as you type
- **Full machine tree** — nested & parallel states, transitions, targets, entry/exit/transition actions, guards, invokes, actors, delays, context, and XState v5 `setup` implementations
- **Smart navigation** — click to jump to source; double-click an action or guard to jump to its implementation, or a transition target to jump to the destination state (or press **F12**)
- **Cursor sync** — the tree highlights the node matching your editor cursor
- **Transitions panel** — select a state to see every edge touching it, the icon showing direction: **`←`** incoming (a transition that leads in) and **`→`** outgoing (a transition out). Click any row to jump to the other state — it becomes the selected state and the panel updates to show _its_ transitions, so you can walk the machine edge by edge
- **Search** — a dedicated search box (styled like the Extensions view) with type filtering and keyboard navigation

### ✏️ Editing & authoring
- **Context-aware autocomplete** — suggests valid machine, state, transition, invoke, and setup properties, plus valid target / action / guard / actor references
- **Tree editing** — add, rename, and delete states, transitions, and references straight from the outline
- **Invalid property highlighting** — unknown config properties show up in the tree with a red error icon

### 🚦 Errors pane
A dedicated **Errors** view collects every problem the static analyzer finds across your machines — also shown inline as editor squiggles.

- **What it catches** — unreachable / orphaned states, unknown action / guard / actor references (not defined in `setup()`), duplicate explicit `id`s, invalid config properties, the deprecated `cond`, and unused `setup` entries
- **Real vs. soft** — genuine runtime failures (unknown references, duplicate ids) are **errors**; static heuristics (unreachable state, invalid property) are **warnings**; deprecations and unused-setup entries are informational
- **Severity filter** — show **all**, **warnings & errors** (the default), or **errors only** to focus on what actually fails at runtime
- **Grouping** — organize problems **by file**, **by severity**, or as a **flat list**, from the title-bar menu
- **Navigate & copy** — click a problem to jump to its source; copy a single issue or a whole group (right-click or **Ctrl/Cmd+C**)
- **At a glance** — a badge shows the total count, and the pane follows the outline's file/workspace scope

### 🗺️ Statechart diagram
- **Visual statechart** — render any machine (or any compound state) as a Harel-style diagram in its own editor tab via **View State Diagram** (from the outline _or_ by right-clicking a machine/state in the code)
- **Every transition kind** — `on` events, `after` (delayed), `always` (transient), invoke `onDone`/`onError`, and state-level `onDone`, with `EVENT [guard] / actions` labels; internal (action-only) transitions and invoked services (`invoke <src>`) show inside the state box
- **Automatic layout** — clean hierarchical layout with smooth, curved transitions
- **Top-down ↔ left-right** — a sensible direction is chosen from the machine's shape (left-right for linear machines, top-down for parallel/large ones); flip it anytime and your choice is remembered
- **Live updates** — the diagram refreshes as you edit the source, **preserving your pan & zoom**, and auto-centers when first opened
- **Pan, zoom & fit**, plus **actual size (100%)** and **expand all / collapse all**
- **Keyboard navigation** — arrow keys move the selection between states, **Enter** expands/collapses a compound or jumps a state to its source, **Shift+arrows** pan, `]`/`[` (or `+`/`-`) zoom, `0`/`.` fit, and `1` actual size
- **Reflects the outline** — collapsed states render as single blocks; click a collapsed block to expand it, or a region's title bar to collapse it
- **Two-way sync** — click a state to select it in the tree, click an event to select its transition, and selecting in the tree (or the editor cursor) highlights it in the diagram; a state's `description` shows as a hover tooltip
- **Hover to focus** — hovering a state emphasizes its transitions and dims the rest
- **Export** the diagram as **SVG** or **PNG**
- **Focus mode** — open the diagram on a compound state to see just that subtree

## Reading the diagram

![A parallel checkout machine rendered as a statechart, with two concurrent regions, entry/exit actions, guarded transitions, and final states](https://github.com/mjbeswick/xstate-devtools/raw/main/packages/vscode-extension/images/checkout.png)

The diagrams **intentionally follow [Harel statechart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram#Harel_statechart) conventions** — the same notation XState itself is based on. Initial-state arrows, nested regions, dashed boundaries for parallel (orthogonal) states, and `EVENT [guard] / action` transition labels are all standard Harel/SCXML notation, so the diagrams read the way a statechart is meant to.

The example above shows a parallel `checkout` machine: the dashed outer box with the `parallel` tag runs its two regions — `payment` and `fulfilment` — concurrently, each with its own initial state (the filled dot), entry/exit actions inside the boxes, guarded transitions like `ADDRESS_VALID [inDeliveryZone]`, and final states (double outline).

| You'll see | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Rounded box | A state |
| Filled dot → state | The initial state of a region |
| Box with a double outline | A final state |
| **Dashed** box with a `parallel` tag | A parallel (orthogonal) state — its regions run concurrently |
| Box with a `⊞` (plus) square | A collapsed compound state (click to expand) |
| Region with a `⊟` (minus) title bar | An expanded region (click the title bar to collapse) |
| Outer titled box | The machine itself |
| Curved arrow with a label | A transition, labelled `EVENT [guard] / actions` |
| `entry/ …` and `exit/ …` inside a box | The state's entry/exit actions |

**Diagram toolbar:** zoom out `−`, the live zoom-percent button (click to reset to **100%**), zoom in `+`, fit `⊡`, toggle direction `↧`/`↦`, expand all `⊞`, collapse all `⊟`, and export `SVG` / `PNG`.

**Diagram keyboard shortcuts:** **arrow keys** move the selection between states, **Enter** expands/collapses the selected compound (or jumps a leaf state to its source), **Shift+arrows** pan, `]`/`[` (or `+`/`-`) zoom, `0` or `.` fits to screen, and `1` resets to actual size.

## Icon & color legend

**State** nodes use custom Harel-statechart shapes — the same notation as the diagram — in a neutral grey with light/dark variants. Every other icon and color is drawn from your **active VS Code theme**, so the extension looks at home in light, dark, and high-contrast themes alike.

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 📦 Blue box | Machine |
| ○ Hollow circle | State |
| ● Filled dot | Initial state |
| ◉ Bullseye (double circle) | Final state |
| ▭ Dashed-split box | Parallel (orthogonal) state |
| Ⓗ Circled **H** | History state |
| 🟠 Orange event | Transition (orange inbox = an `on` handler group; ⚡ `always`, 🕐 `after`) |
| 🎯 Magenta target | Transition target |
| 🚀 Action · ⤓ entry · ⤒ exit | Actions (entry/exit/transition) |
| 🛡️ Cyan shield | Guard |
| 🔌 Yellow board | Invoke · ▶️ actor |
| 🕘 Delay · ⚙️ setup section | Timing & v5 `setup` blocks |
| 🔤 Context · 🔧 context property | Machine context |
| ❌ Red error | Invalid / unknown property |

In the diagram, state borders, arrows, and labels follow your editor's foreground color; state fills use the editor widget background; a **selected** state is filled with your theme's selection color and outlined with the focus color. The **initial** dot follows the foreground color (a solid black dot on light themes, per Harel convention); a **final** state's inner outline is red, and **parallel** states use a blue dashed border.

## Supported patterns

The extension detects statically defined machines in these forms:

**XState v4**
```typescript
const machine = createMachine({ ... });
const machine = Machine({ ... });
```

**XState v5**
```typescript
const machine = setup({ ... }).createMachine({ ... });
const machine = journeySetup.createMachine({ ... });
const config  = createStateConfig({ ... });
const config  = stateConfig({ ... });
```

It also surfaces v5 `setup` sections:

```typescript
const machine = setup({
  actions: { saveDraft: () => {} },
  guards: { canSubmit: () => true },
  actors: { loadUser: fromPromise(async () => {}) },
  delays: { RETRY_DELAY: 1000 }
}).createMachine({ ... });
```

## Tips

- The Outline title bar has toggles for **scope** (file/workspace), **view mode** (grouped/flat), **state configs**, **cursor following**, whether the **diagram reflects tree expansion**, **grouping event handlers** under `on`, and **child sort order**.
- **Right-click** any tree node for editing actions and **Go to Implementation**.
- In **Search**, use ↑/↓/Enter to move through results and the funnel button to filter by node type.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xstateOutline.defaultScope` | `workspace` | Scan the current file only, or the whole workspace |
| `xstateOutline.defaultViewMode` | `flat` | Flat list of machines, or grouped by file |
| `xstateOutline.showStateConfigs` | `false` | Include `createStateConfig`/`stateConfig` patterns in the outline |
| `xstateOutline.followCursor` | `true` | Reveal the tree node matching the editor cursor |
| `xstateOutline.graphReflectsTreeExpansion` | `true` | Make the diagram render only the states expanded in the outline |
| `xstateOutline.groupEventHandlers` | `false` | Group a state's event-handler transitions under an `on` node |
| `xstateOutline.sortChildren` | `original` | Order child nodes by source order (`original`) or alphabetically (`sorted`) |
| `xstateOutline.errorsGrouping` | `file` | How the Errors pane groups problems: `file`, `severity`, or `flat` |
| `xstateOutline.errorsFilter` | `warning` | Minimum severity shown in the Errors pane: `all`, `warning` (warnings & errors), or `error` |

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code **1.78.0** or higher
- A JavaScript or TypeScript project using XState

## Known limitations

- Detects statically defined machines only (not dynamically generated ones)
- Context values are shown one level deep to avoid clutter
- Tree editing focuses on common object/string forms; advanced shapes may still need manual source edits
- In a focused sub-diagram, transitions whose target lies outside the selected subtree are not drawn

## Credits & acknowledgements

This extension exists because of [**XState**](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate) and the team at [**Stately**](https://stately.ai). XState is a wonderful, rigorous library — it brings real statecharts to JavaScript and TypeScript, with first-class support for hierarchy, parallel regions, guards, actors, and more, all grounded in decades-old, battle-tested theory. It makes complex application logic predictable, testable, and a genuine pleasure to work with.
